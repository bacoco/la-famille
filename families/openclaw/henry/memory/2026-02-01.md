# 2026-02-01 — Daily Notes

## Daily Briefing
- Delivered Feb 1 briefing via Telegram: Moltbot viral agent, SpaceX AI satellites, Anthropic Cowork Plugins, IPO at $350B

## MyPaper Product Research
- Loic asked for deeper research on "MyPaper" — AI-personalized daily newspaper concept
- **Name conflicts found**: mypaper.io (micropayments/paywall), MyPaper AI news UK app (Google Play), mypaper.sg (Singapore news), mypaperonline.com (NJ local news)
- **Artifact shutdown** (Jan 2024): Instagram founders' AI news app closed — "market too small". Major cautionary signal.
- **Micropayments for news historically fail** — publishers prefer full subscriptions
- **LLM costs**: GPT-4o-mini ~$0.15/1M input, $0.60/1M output → ~$0.75 per 1000 summarization requests. Very cheap per user.
- **SaaS churn benchmarks**: monthly gross revenue churn median 6-9%
- Product brief v1 at `projects/daily-brief/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md`
- Competitive landscape: ChatGPT Pulse ($200/mo subscription required), Perplexity Discover, Flipboard, Artifact (dead), newsletters
- Key differentiator idea: conversational onboarding → personalized web page → auto-updated daily
- MVP estimate: 4-6 weeks, ~$600/month for 1000 users, freemium at $5/month Pro
- **Recommendation pending**: need to synthesize all research into final assessment for Loic

## Gmail Account Creation — Failed
- Attempted headless browser creation — credentials communiqués à Loic séparément
- First attempt: no phone → Google blocked
- Second attempt: SMS verified but still blocked at password step
- **Root cause**: Google anti-bot detection on headless Chromium + datacenter IP — insurmountable
- Loic must create manually

## Council Issues Still Open
- Escalation loop has NO semaphore protection → OOM risk (CRITICAL, unfixed)
- Convergence score calculated on immutable COLLECT responses → never changes across rounds
- Council self-review via Council not viable — Claude CLI explores filesystem → 6+ min → OOM
- All 3 attempts at council meta-review SIGKILL'd
